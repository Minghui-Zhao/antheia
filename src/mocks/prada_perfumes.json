        "Wow, I got a rollerball in a swap...what a wonderful treat! Such a soft, rich cocoa smell, but creamy smooth. Surprisingly great for hot weather, and there's a touch of warmth/spice.",
        "On me, it's soft and subtle, with a hint of smokiness but it isn't overpowering and lasts a long time. A beautiful vanilla scent with hints of chocolate and caramel."
