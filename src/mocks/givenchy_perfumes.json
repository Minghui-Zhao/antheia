        "This is the only fragrance I get complimented on everytime I use it. I’m so in love with it. Very elegant classy and feminine. It last all day and night.",
        "Sweet, fresh, unique, modern. Patchouli doesn’t smell like angel of mugler. Since I hate most patchouli this one is great, tuberose overpowers it and it’s so balanced. I would say a perfect blind buy."
